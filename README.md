> A legislative analysis of the Philippines

This project aims to:

- compile a quantitative dataset on the legislative process for Republic
  Acts in the Philippines and make that available publicly,
- apply some process analysis tools to shed light on the efficiency of
  the legislative process, and
- provide interactive tools for citizens to explore that data on their
  own.
